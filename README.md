This integration allows to monitor Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) battery management systems (BMS) from within [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). After installation, no configuration is required. You can use the [ESPHome Bluetooth proxy][btproxy-url] to extend the bluetooth coverage range. By using standard dashboard cards, it is easy to visualize the current state of remote batteries.

### Provided Information
The integration provides the following information about the battery

Platform | Description | Unit | Details
-- | -- | -- | --
`sensor` | SoC (state of charge) | `%` | range 100% (full) to 0% (battery empty)
`sensor` | stored energy | `Wh` | currently stored energy
`sensor` | voltage | `V` | overall battery voltage
`sensor` | current | `A` | positive for charging, negative for discharging
`sensor` | power | `W` | positive for charging, negative for discharging
`sensor` | temperature | `Â°C` | individual temperature values are available as attribute to this sensor, if the BMS supports multiple sensors
`sensor` | (remaining) runtime | `s` | remaining discharge time till SoC 0%
`sensor` | charge cycles | `#` |
`sensor` | delta voltage | `V` | maximum difference between any two cells; individual cell voltage are available as attribute to this sensor
`binary_sensor` | battery charging indicator | `bool` | true if battery is charging


## Installation
### Automatic
Installation can be done using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) by [adding a custom repository](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/).

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=patman15&repository=BMS_BLE-HA&category=Integration)

### Manual
1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
1. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
1. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `bms_ble`.
1. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/bms_ble/` directory (folder) in this repository.
1. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
1. Restart Home Assistant
1. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "BLE Battery Management"

## Outlook
- Add option to only have temporary connections (lowers reliability, but helps running more devices via [ESPHome Bluetooth proxy][btproxy-url])
- Add further battery types on [request](https://github.com/patman15/BMS_BLE-HA/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yml)

## Troubleshooting
In case you have severe troubles,

- please enable the debug protocol for the integration,
- reproduce the issue,
- disable the log (Home Assistant will prompt you to download the log), and finally
- [open an issue](https://github.com/patman15/BMS_BLE-HA/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bug&projects=&template=bug.yml) with a good description of what happened and attach the log.

## FAQ
### My sensors show unknown/unavailable at startup!
The polling interval is 30 seconds. So at startup it takes a few minutes to detect the battery and query the sensors. Then data will be available.

### Can I have the runtime in human readable format (using days)?
Yes, you can use a [template sensor](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=template) or a card to show templates, e.g. [Mushroom template card](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom) with the following template:<br>
`{{ timedelta(seconds=int(states("sensor.smartbat_..._runtime"), 0)) }}` results in e,g, `4 days, 4:20:00`

### How do I get the cell voltages as individual sensor for tracking?
The individual voltages are available as attribute to the `delta voltage` sensor. Click the sensor and at the bottom of the graph expand the `attribute` section. Alternatively, you can also find them in the [developer tools](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_states/).
To create individual sensors, go to [Settings > Devices & Services > Helper](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/helpers) and [add a template sensor](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=template) for each cell you want to monitor. Fill the configuration for, e.g. the first cell (0), as follows:

Field | Content
-- | --
State template | ```{{ iif(has_value("sensor.smartbat_..._delta_voltage"), state_attr("sensor.smartbat_..._delta_voltage", "cell_voltages")[0], None) }}```<br>The index `[0]` can be in the range from 0 to the number of cells-1, i.e. 0-3 for a 4 cell battery.
Unit of measurement | `V`
Device class | `Voltage`
State class | `Measurement`
Device | `smartbat_...`

or add the following snippet to your `configuration.yaml`:
```javascript
template:
  - sensor:
    - name: cell_voltage_0
      state: >-
        {{ state_attr('sensor.smartbat_..._delta_voltage', 'cell_voltages')[0] }}
      unit_of_measurement: 'V'
      state_class: measurement
      device_class: voltage
      availability: >- 
        {{ has_value('sensor.smartbat_..._delta_voltage') }}
```

### I want to know the maximum cell voltage!
Please follow the explanations in the previous question but use the following:

Field | Content
-- | --
State template | `{%- if has_value("sensor.smartbat_..._delta_voltage") %} {{ state_attr("sensor.smartbat_..._delta_voltage", "cell_voltages") \| max }} {% else %} None {% endif -%}`

There are plenty more functions you can use, e.g. min, and the full power of [templating](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating/).

### I need a discharge sensor not the charging indicator, can I have that?
Sure, use, e.g. a [threshold sensor](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=threshold) based on the current to/from the battery. Negative means discharging, positiv is charging.

### My BMS needs a pin, how can I enter it?

Then you need to pair your device first. This is procedure is only required once for each device.
- Open a [terminal to Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/supervised/#installing-and-using-the-ssh-add-on).
- Use the command `bluetoothctl devices` to check that your devices is detected and
- run `bluetoothctl pair <MAC_of_BMS>` to start pairing the device.

Once pairing is done, the integration should automatically detect the BMS.
