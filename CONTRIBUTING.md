## Issues
In case you have troubles, please enable the debug protocol for the integration and [open an issue](https://github.com/patman15/BMS_BLE-HA/issues) with a good description of what happened and the relevant snippet from the log.

## Adding a new battery management system

 1. Fork the repository and create a branch with the name of the new BMS to add.
 2. Add a new file to the `plugins` folder called, e.g. `my_bms.py`
 3. Populate the file with class called `BMS` derived from `BaseBMS`(see basebms.py). A dummy implementation without the actual functionality to query the BMS can befound below in section _Dummy BMS Example_
 4. Make sure that the dictionary returned by `async_update()` has (all) keys listed in `SENSOR_TYPES` (see `sensor.py`), __except__ for the RSSI value which is automatically added by the data update coordinator. To make it simple, just follow the `ATTR_*` import in the example code below.
 5. In `const.py` add the filename (without extention), e.g. `my_bms`, to the constant `BMS_TYPES`.
 6. Add an appropriate [bluetooth device matcher](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_integration_manifest#bluetooth) to `manifest.json`. Note that this is required to match the implementation of `match_dict_list()` in the new BMS class.
 7. Test and commit the changes to the branch and create a pull request to the main repository.

Note: in order to keep maintainability of this integration, pull requests are required to pass standard Home Assistant checks for integrations, Python linting, and 100% [branch test coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/branch.html#branch).
