# BT630 Pro BMS Smart Shunt Documentation

## Overview

The BT630 "Pro BMS" is actually a smart shunt device, not a full battery management system. It measures system-level battery parameters (voltage, current, temperature, SOC) via Bluetooth Low Energy. The device requires an initialization sequence before streaming data via BLE notifications.

The version used for analysis and developing this plugin was: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8HV7Q8K
"FOXWELL BT630 600A Smart Battery Monitor with Shunt, 10–120V Real-Time Volts, Amps, Watts, Capacity & Runtime Tracking, High and Low Voltage Alarm for RV/Solar Panel/Marine/Off‑Grid/Backup Power"

Which appears to be a specific branding of the white-label: https://leagend.com/products/cm100

Protocol documentation is available here but seems to not always be correct: https://doc.dh5z.com/bt630/UserManual.html

**Important Protocol Note**: While the official BT630 protocol documentation specifies Function 0x56 for real-time data, extensive testing has shown this does not work. The working implementation uses Function 0x43, which the documentation labels as "historical data" but actually provides real-time values.

**CRITICAL UPDATE (2025-08)**: Extensive protocol analysis revealed multiple field misinterpretations. The ÷155 formula for "design_capacity" was a mathematical coincidence - those bytes are actually part of a timestamp. Several fields have been corrected based on the actual protocol specification.

## Device Identification

- **Local Name**: "Pro BMS"
- **Service UUID**: `0000fff0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- **Notification Characteristic**: `0000fff4-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (read/notify)
- **Write Characteristic**: `0000fff3-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (write)

### Device Discovery

The Pro BMS is detected using:
- Exact local name match: "Pro BMS"
- Service UUID: `0000fff0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- Must be connectable

**Note**: The device exhibits unusual Bluetooth LE advertisement behavior, broadcasting with hundreds of different manufacturer IDs in a single advertisement packet. Due to this behavior and conflicts with other BMS devices (particularly CBTPWR which matches on the same service UUID with manufacturer ID 0), the ProBMS matcher relies only on the exact local name and service UUID for detection. The manufacturer ID has been removed from the matcher to ensure proper device detection.

### Device Name Handling

The plugin includes robust device name handling to address cases where:
- The device name is `None` during initial discovery
- The device advertises its MAC address as the name instead of "Pro BMS"

When these conditions are detected, the plugin automatically creates a new BLEDevice instance with the proper "Pro BMS" name to ensure compatibility with Home Assistant's coordinator requirements.

## BLE Communication Protocol

### Initialization Sequence

The device requires a complete 4-command handshake sequence for initialization:

```python
# Step 1: Send initialization command (Function 0x04)
CMD_INIT = "55aa0a0101558004077f648e682b"

# Step 2: Wait for initialization response (Type 0x03)
# Response example: 55aa080380aa01040000002c52

# Step 3: Send ACK command (Function 0x40)
CMD_ACK = "55aa070101558040000095"

# Step 4: Send data stream command (Function 0x42)
CMD_DATA_STREAM = "55aa070101558042000097"

# Step 5: Send trigger data command (Function 0x43) - CRITICAL
CMD_TRIGGER_DATA = "55aa0901015580430000120084"

# Step 6: Receive continuous data packets (Type 0x04)
```

The complete sequence is: Init → Init Response → ACK → Data Stream → **Trigger Data** → Continuous Data.

**Important**: The 4th command (CMD_TRIGGER_DATA with Function 0x43) is critical for starting the data flow. Without this command, the device will not stream data. The device may send multiple initialization response packets (type 0x03) during the handshake.

### Transition Period

After the initialization sequence completes, the device may continue sending initialization response packets (type 0x03) for a short period before transitioning to real-time data packets (type 0x04). The integration handles this transition period by:

- Waiting up to 1 second after initialization for the device to stabilize
- Retrying data packet reception up to 5 times with short delays
- Only considering packets of type 0x04 with at least 45 bytes as valid data

This ensures reliable data collection even when the device takes time to transition from initialization mode to data streaming mode.

### Data Packet Format (50 bytes) - CORRECTED 2025-08-06

After initialization, the device streams 50-byte packets at ~1Hz via notifications:

| Offset | Size | Field | Description | Formula/Units |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 0-1 | 2 | Header | Fixed: `0x55 0xAA` | Start marker |
| 2 | 1 | Length | `0x2D` (45 bytes follow) | - |
| 3 | 1 | Type | `0x04` (real-time data) | - |
| 4-7 | 4 | Fixed | `0x80 0xAA 0x01 0x70` | Protocol bytes |
| 8-9 | 2 | Voltage | Battery voltage | Little-endian, `value * 0.01` V |
| 10-11 | 2 | Unknown | - | - |
| 12-13 | 2 | Current | Current magnitude | Little-endian, `value / 1000.0` A |
| 14 | 1 | Unknown | - | - |
| 15 | 1 | Status/Direction | Bit 7: discharge flag (1=discharge, 0=charge) | Bits 0-6: protection status |
| 16-18 | 3 | Temperature | Primary temperature sensor | 2 bytes value (little-endian) + 1 byte sign |
| 19 | 1 | Unknown | Reserved (always 0x00) | - |
| 20-23 | 4 | **Remaining Capacity** | Current charge in battery | Little-endian, `value / 100.0` Ah |
| 24 | 1 | **State of Charge** | Battery percentage | Direct value, 0-100% |
| 25-27 | 3 | **Reserved/Unused** | Always 0x000000 | Confirmed unused in all 987 analyzed packets |
| 28-29 | 2 | **Runtime (BMS)** | BMS-provided runtime (has firmware bug) | Little-endian minutes - NOT USED due to bug |
| 30-31 | 2 | Unknown/Reserved | - | - |
| 32-35 | 4 | **Power** | Power in Watts | Little-endian, `value * 0.01` W |
| 36-39 | 4 | **Total Discharge Capacity** | Cumulative discharge | Little-endian, `value / 10.0` Ah |
| 40-43 | 4 | **Timestamp** | Unix timestamp | Little-endian, seconds since epoch |
| 44-49 | 6 | Unknown/Reserved | - | - |

### Field Correction History

**2025-08-06 Comprehensive Analysis**: Analyzed 987 packets from real BMS data to identify correct field offsets and validate calculations:

1. **Power Field (bytes 32-35)**:
   - **Corrected**: Now properly reads 4 bytes from offset 28 in data section (bytes 32-35 in full packet)
   - **Validation**: Matches V×I calculations with only 0.019% average error across 987 packets
   - **Issue Fixed**: Previously incorrectly located at bytes 28-31 and thought to be only 2 bytes
   - **Why 4 bytes needed**: Found packets with power values of ~704-706W which exceed 2-byte limit of 655.35W

2. **Runtime Field (bytes 28-29)**:
   - **BMS Firmware Bug Discovered**: BMS-provided runtime has calculation errors at high currents
   - **Solution**: Plugin now ignores BMS runtime value and uses base class calculation from capacity/current
   - **Previous Issue**: Was incorrectly reading from bytes 32-35, causing erratic behavior

3. **Reserved Bytes (25-27)**:
   - **Confirmed**: All 987 analyzed packets show 0x000000
   - **Status**: Marked as unused/reserved

**Previous Field Misinterpretations (Pre-2025-08)**:
- **Remaining Capacity**: Formula confusion resolved (now clearly `value / 100`)
- **Design Capacity**: Completely removed - bytes 40-41 are part of Unix timestamp
- **Runtime/Power Swap**: Fields were reading from wrong locations causing incorrect values

### Runtime Field

**Important**: The BMS has a firmware bug in runtime calculation at high currents. The plugin now calculates runtime using the base class implementation instead of parsing the BMS-provided value.

**BMS Runtime Field (bytes 28-29) - NOT USED**:
- Location: Bytes 28-29 contain BMS-calculated runtime in minutes
- Issue: BMS firmware bug causes incorrect calculations at high discharge currents
- Solution: Plugin ignores this field and uses base class calculation

**Actual Runtime Calculation**:
- Calculated by base class from: `remaining_capacity / abs(current)`
- More accurate and reliable than BMS-provided value
- Automatically handles both charge and discharge scenarios
- No firmware bugs or calculation errors

**Reserved Bytes**: Bytes 25-27 are confirmed unused (always 0x000000 in all 987 analyzed packets)

### Data Conversion Details

1. **Voltage**:
   - Read 16-bit little-endian from bytes 8-9
   - Multiply by 0.01 to get voltage in Volts

2. **Current**:
   - Read 4 bytes starting at offset 12 (bytes 12-15)
   - Bytes 12-13: Current magnitude as 16-bit little-endian unsigned (mA)
   - Byte 15 bit 7: Discharge flag (1 = discharging, 0 = charging)
   - Lambda implementation: `((x & 0xFFFF) / 1000.0) * (-1 if (x >> 24) & 0x80 else 1)`
     - `x & 0xFFFF`: Extract lower 16 bits (magnitude from bytes 12-13)
     - `x >> 24`: Shift to get byte 15
     - `& 0x80`: Check bit 7 for discharge flag
     - Divide by 1000 to convert mA to Amps
     - Apply negative sign if discharging

3. **Temperature**:
   - Read 3 bytes starting at offset 12 (bytes 16-18)
   - Bytes 16-17: Temperature magnitude as 16-bit little-endian unsigned (0.1°C units)
   - Byte 18: Sign byte (0x00 = positive, non-zero = negative)
   - Lambda implementation: `((x & 0xFFFF) / 10.0) * (1 if (x >> 16) == 0x00 else -1)`
     - `x & 0xFFFF`: Extract lower 16 bits (magnitude from bytes 16-17)
     - `x >> 16`: Shift to get byte 18 (sign byte)
     - Check if sign byte is 0x00 for positive temperature
     - Divide by 10 to convert from 0.1°C units to °C
     - Apply negative sign if sign byte is non-zero
   - Note: Current implementation follows the protocol specification using all 3 bytes,
     though in practice bytes 17-18 are typically 0x00 0x00 for room temperature readings

4. **Protection Status**:
   - Lower 7 bits of byte 15 indicate protection/error conditions
   - Bit meanings:
     - 0x01: Overvoltage
     - 0x02: Undervoltage
     - 0x04: Overcurrent
     - 0x08: Overtemperature
     - 0x10: Undertemperature
     - 0x20: Short circuit
     - 0x40: Cell imbalance

5. **Remaining Capacity** (CORRECTED):
   - Read 4 bytes starting at offset 16 (bytes 20-23)
   - Little-endian value in 0.01 Ah units
   - Formula: `value / 100.0` to get Ah
   - Note: Previously used confusing `value * 10 / 1000.0` which gave same result

6. **State of Charge (SOC)**:
   - Read byte 24 directly as percentage (0-100)

7. **Reserved Bytes**:
   - Bytes 25-27 are unused/reserved (always 0x000000)
   - Not processed by the plugin

8. **Runtime**:
   - **NOT PARSED FROM BMS** due to firmware calculation bug
   - BMS field at bytes 28-29 contains flawed runtime calculation
   - Base class calculates from: `remaining_capacity / abs(current)`
   - More accurate than BMS-provided value

9. **Power** (CORRECTED 2025-08-06):
   - Read 32-bit little-endian from bytes 32-35 (offset 28 in data section)
   - Multiply by 0.01 to get Watts
   - Positive when charging, negative when discharging
   - Validated: Matches V×I with 0.019% average error (987 packets analyzed)
   - 4 bytes required to handle values above 655W (max found: ~706W)

10. **Total Discharge Capacity**:
    - Read 32-bit little-endian from bytes 36-39
    - Formula: `value / 10.0` to get Ah
    - This is cumulative discharge capacity
    - Note: Not exposed as a sensor due to BMSvalue constraints

## Calculated Values

The plugin calculates these additional values:

1. **Battery Charging**: `True` if current > 0, `False` otherwise
2. **Design Capacity**: Calculated from remaining capacity and SOC: `remaining_capacity / (SOC / 100)` when SOC > 0
3. **Cycle Capacity**: `voltage × remaining_capacity` (Wh)
4. **Cycle Charge**: Same as remaining capacity (Ah) - using existing BMSvalue field name

Note: The previously bogus "design_capacity" field from bytes 40-41 has been removed. Design capacity is now properly calculated from remaining capacity and SOC.

## Home Assistant Integration

The plugin exposes these entities:

### Sensors (Read-Only)
- `sensor.pro_bms_voltage` - Battery voltage (V)
- `sensor.pro_bms_current` - Current flow (A, positive = charging, negative = discharging)
- `sensor.pro_bms_battery` - State of charge (%)
- `sensor.pro_bms_temperature` - Temperature (°C)
- `sensor.pro_bms_power` - Power (W) - provided directly by BMS
- `sensor.pro_bms_runtime` - Remaining time in seconds (calculated by base class from capacity/current, NOT from BMS due to firmware bug)
- `sensor.pro_bms_stored_energy` - Stored energy / Cycle capacity (Wh)

### Binary Sensors
- `binary_sensor.pro_bms_battery_charging` - Charging status (on = charging)

### Internal Values (not exposed as sensors)
- `cycle_charge` - Remaining capacity in battery (Ah)
- `design_capacity` - Total battery capacity (Ah) - calculated from remaining/SOC

### Template Sensor for Charge Time Remaining

Add this to your `configuration.yaml` to calculate estimated charge time:

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Pro BMS Charge Time Remaining"
        unique_id: pro_bms_charge_time_remaining

## Implementation Notes

1. **Function 0x43 vs 0x56**: Despite documentation, Function 0x43 provides real-time data
2. **4-Command Initialization**: Complete sequence required: Init → ACK → Data Stream → Trigger Data (0x43)
3. **Critical 4th Command**: The CMD_TRIGGER_DATA (Function 0x43) command is essential for starting data flow
4. **Multiple Init Responses**: Device may send 2-3 init response packets before data
5. **Checksum**: Currently bypassed as the algorithm differs from documentation
6. **Buffer Management**: Robust handling of fragmented packets and buffer alignment
7. **Device Name Handling**: Automatic correction when device name is None or MAC address
8. **Protection Status**: Monitored via byte 15 (lower 7 bits) for safety alerts
9. **Field Corrections (2025-08-06)**: Power field at correct offset 28 (4 bytes), runtime calculated by base class
10. **Calculated Design Capacity**: Derived from remaining capacity and SOC (timestamp bytes 40-43 were misinterpreted)
11. **Runtime Calculation**: Base class handles this due to BMS firmware bug
12. **Power Field Size**: Must be 4 bytes to handle high power values (>655W)

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
pytest tests/test_pro_bms.py -v
```

### Test Coverage (100% Achieved)

The test suite has been simplified and improved based on the 2025-08-06 analysis:

**Core Test Areas**:
- Packet parsing with validated field offsets
- Power field validation (4 bytes at offset 28)
- Runtime calculation by base class (not parsed from BMS)
- Current direction handling (charge/discharge)
- Temperature range validation
- Buffer management and alignment
- Device name correction
- Protection status detection

**Key Test Improvements**:
- Removed tests for bogus design_capacity field (bytes 40-41)
- Added physics validation for power field (V×I = P)
- Simplified runtime testing (base class calculation only)
- Confirmed bytes 25-27 are unused
- Validated against 987 real-world packets

**Test Data**:
- Based on actual BMS packet captures
- Power values tested up to 706W (requiring 4 bytes)
- All field offsets verified with real data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Device not discovered | Name is None or MAC address | Plugin auto-corrects to "Pro BMS" |
| No data after init | Missing 4th command (0x43) | Ensure all 4 commands are sent in sequence |
| Wrong current direction | Incorrect byte/bit check | Use byte 15 bit 7 for direction |
| Temperature shows unexpected value | Check device readings | Verify with actual device data |
| SOC shows 0% | Device calibrating | Wait 10-30 seconds after connection |
| Runtime incorrect | BMS firmware bug at high currents | Plugin calculates from capacity/current instead |
| Power field wrong (pre-2025-08-06) | Was at wrong offset | Now at bytes 32-35 (offset 28), validated with V×I |
| Design capacity wrong | Was reading timestamp bytes | Now calculated from remaining/SOC |
| Slow initialization | Multiple init packets | Normal behavior, wait for data packets |
| Buffer alignment issues | Fragmented packets | Fixed with proper header search |
| Device detected but no data | Incomplete init sequence | Must send all 4 commands including CMD_TRIGGER_DATA |
